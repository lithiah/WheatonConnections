            <div style="color: #381252;"><p>This website allows you to browse the pre-approved connections available at Wheaton College (MA). On the Filter Connections Page, they're sorted by number of courses within the connection (always either two or three), the divisions of the courses, and the major and minor departments of the courses. In addition, one specific course can be selected, and the connections that include that course will be displayed. (Only courses that are part of a connection are listed.) On the Connections Visualizer, you can see an interactive Force-Directed Graph of all offered Connections. Finally, the Student-Initiated Connections form is offered, which can then be submitted to the Registrar's.</p>

                    This website was created by <a href="https://github.com/akuisara">Sara Zhang</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lithiah">Lithia Helmreich</a> of Wheaton College for a computer science course homework assignment (<a href="https://github.com/WheatonWHALE/comp398/blob/master/hw/hw11.md">#11</a> to be exact). All connection information was taken from the Wheaton College website connections listings, found <a href="http://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/the-wheaton-curriculum/connections/connections-list/">here</a>. The <a href="http://getuikit.com/index.html">UIKit framework</a> was used to make it pretty looking (and functional-ish).
